# App::CELL's own internal messages. This file
# is stored in the "distro sharedir" and is always loaded 
# before the files in the application sitedir.
#
# In addition to being used by App::CELL, the files in the
# distro sharedir (CELL_MetaConfig.pm, CELL_Config.pm, and
# CELL_SiteConfig.pm along with CELL_Message_en.conf,
# CELL_Message_cz.conf, etc.) can be used as models for 
# populating the application sitedir.
